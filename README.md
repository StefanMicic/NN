# NN

Goal of this project is to try 3 approaches for image captioning.

1. Encoder-decoder architecture + Attention mechanism
2. Encoder-decoder architectur without attention
3. RNN which will have Image + words as input and as output will have word

For training process MSCOCO data will be used and for evaluation of models images from google will be scraped. 
Metrics which will be tried are BLEU, ROUGE, Doc2Vec + Cosine
